### **📝 What the Client Told Me (In Detail)**  

#### **1️⃣ Their Existing System**  
The client is managing an **industrial automation system** that relies on **BACnet controllers (AS-P DDC)** to collect **real-time IoT data** from various panels and sensors. These controllers act as intermediaries between the field devices (like sensors, HVAC, or other automation equipment) and the central servers where the data is processed and stored.  

- The **AS-P DDC BACnet controllers** are responsible for **fetching and temporarily storing** data from the field devices.  
- The collected data is then **transferred to Server A (Primary Server)** for processing and storage in a **MySQL database**.  
- This setup allows the client to monitor data directly from the database without needing additional dashboards or visualization tools.  

---

#### **2️⃣ The Problem They Faced**  
Despite having an established system, they have encountered **data loss issues** during the data transfer process from:  

🔹 **Panels → BACnet Controllers**  
🔹 **BACnet Controllers → Server A**  
🔹 **Server A → MySQL Database**  

These losses happen **frequently**, and the primary reason is **power failures, network instability, or system crashes**, which cause some data records to be missing or incorrectly timestamped.  

✅ The missing data creates **gaps in their monitoring records**, making it difficult to analyze trends, track performance, or ensure the reliability of their automated systems.  

---

#### **3️⃣ Their Previous Solution: The Delmon Tool**  
To tackle this issue in the past, they used **a third-party tool called Delmon Tool**, which had the following functions:  

✔️ It would **detect missing data** between the BACnet controllers and MySQL.  
✔️ It would **resync lost data** between **Server A and Server B**, ensuring that the MySQL database remained complete and accurate.  
✔️ It provided a **basic data monitoring** function to check for inconsistencies.  

However, **Delmon Tool is no longer supported**, meaning:  
🚫 No developer support to fix issues.  
🚫 No software updates or improvements.  
🚫 The tool is no longer compatible with their evolving system.  

With **Delmon Tool now obsolete**, the client needs **a new solution** that can **ensure reliable, continuous data transfer and prevent data loss**.

---

#### **4️⃣ What They Need from Us (Our Solution)**  
Since the **Delmon Tool is no longer available**, they now require **a replacement solution** that can perform the same functions **without any third-party dependency**. Specifically, they are asking for:  

✅ **A tool that continuously monitors and ensures data integrity** → If data is missing or not inserted correctly, the tool should detect it and attempt to recover/resend the lost data.  

✅ **A reliable mechanism to prevent data loss** → Even if **power failures** or **network issues** occur, data should be buffered and retried when the connection is restored.  

✅ **Seamless, automatic data syncing from BACnet Controllers → MySQL** → No manual intervention required, everything should run in the background.  

✅ **No need for dashboards, alerts, or notifications** → They **only** monitor data directly from the **MySQL database**, so the tool should focus purely on **data consistency** rather than visualization.  

✅ **A simple, local execution method** →  
- The client does **not** want cloud-based deployment or additional installations.  
- They expect to **receive a ZIP file**, extract it on their server, and **run the tool locally**.  
- The tool should be **lightweight and easy to use** with minimal configuration.  

---

### **🛠️ Summary of What We Need to Build**  
✔️ **A Java Spring Boot-based tool** that continuously **fetches data from BACnet controllers** and **ensures MySQL database integrity**.  
✔️ **Automatic detection and re-syncing of missing data** to eliminate gaps in records.  
✔️ **Local execution via a ZIP file**, making it easy to deploy and run on their internal servers.  
✔️ **No unnecessary UI, alerts, or dashboards**, just a background service handling data transfer.  

---

### **📌 Next Steps**  
Now that we fully understand the client’s requirements, we can move forward with:  

1️⃣ **Designing the System Architecture**  
2️⃣ **Choosing the Best Tech Stack**  
3️⃣ **Planning the Development Process**  

Let’s build a **robust, scalable, and reliable** solution to solve the client’s data loss problem! 🚀

### **📝 Explaining BACnet Controllers (AS-P DDC) in Detail for the Team**  

Before diving into what the client told us, let’s first understand **BACnet controllers** and the **AS-P DDC** device so that everyone on the team has clarity.  

---

### **📌 What is BACnet?**  
**BACnet (Building Automation and Control Network)** is a communication protocol specifically designed for **building automation systems** (BAS). It allows different devices—like HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, lighting controls, sensors, and security systems—to communicate with each other regardless of manufacturer.  

Think of **BACnet** as the **"common language"** that allows **building automation devices** to talk to each other.  

---

### **📌 What is a BACnet Controller?**  
A **BACnet controller** is a device that **manages and controls** other building automation components. It collects **real-time data** from sensors, thermostats, and equipment like HVAC systems, then processes and sends this data to **a central server**.  

---

### **📌 What is an AS-P DDC Controller?**  
The **AS-P (Automation Server Premium)** is a **BACnet-based controller** developed by **Schneider Electric**. It is part of the **EcoStruxure Building Operation** system, commonly used in **smart buildings** to control HVAC, lighting, access control, and other automation systems.  

It is a type of **DDC (Direct Digital Controller)**, meaning it:  
✔️ **Directly manages field devices** (sensors, actuators, thermostats)  
✔️ **Processes data** in real-time  
✔️ **Stores temporary data** before pushing it to a server  
✔️ **Communicates via BACnet/IP or BACnet MS/TP**  

**🛠️ In simple terms:**  
🔹 The **AS-P DDC controller** is a mini-computer sitting between sensors and the main server.  
🔹 It **collects** temperature, humidity, or energy usage data.  
🔹 It then **sends** this data to **Server A** (Primary Server) for storage and monitoring.  

---

### **📌 How Data Flows from the BACnet Controller to MySQL Server?**  
Let’s break this down into steps:  

1️⃣ **Sensors & Field Devices** (e.g., temperature sensors, humidity monitors) collect raw data.  
2️⃣ **AS-P BACnet Controller (DDC)** processes this data and temporarily holds it.  
3️⃣ **Server A** fetches this data from the BACnet Controller over the **BACnet/IP protocol**.  
4️⃣ **Server A** stores this data in **MySQL**, where the client monitors it.  

**🔷 Data Flow Diagram:**  
```text
[Sensors] → [BACnet AS-P DDC] → [Server A] → [MySQL Database]
```

---

### **📌 What Problem is the Client Facing?**  
1️⃣ **Data Loss:** Sometimes, data is lost when transferring from **BACnet panels → AS-P DDC → Server A** due to **network failures, power outages, or software issues**.  
2️⃣ **Timestamp Issues:** Some records have **missing or incorrect timestamps**, making historical analysis difficult.  
3️⃣ **Obsolete Software:** They used **Delmon Tool** to sync missing data between Server A and B, but it’s no longer available.  
4️⃣ **No Backup System:** If the server is down, no mechanism is available to **store and retry data insertion** later.  

---

### **📌 What They Expect from Our Solution?**  
✅ **A replacement for Delmon Tool** → A **Spring Boot-based tool** that ensures continuous data syncing.  
✅ **Reliable data collection** → Our tool should fetch **missing or lost data** from AS-P controllers and insert it into MySQL.  
✅ **No data loss** → Temporary buffering (e.g., SQLite/H2) to store data if the server is down, then retry when the connection is restored.  
✅ **Local execution** → No cloud dependencies; the client will **download a ZIP file, extract it, and run it on their server**.  
✅ **No UI or dashboard needed** → They will directly monitor data in MySQL.

### **🔹 Next Steps: What We Will Do?**  
Now that we understand **BACnet controllers (AS-P DDC) and the client's requirements**, we can start designing a **reliable solution** to prevent data loss and ensure proper data syncing.  

📌 **Next, we will:**  
✔️ Design a **System Architecture** 🏗️
